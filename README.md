##Here are the rules of Conway's Game of Life:

1. Underpopulation: If a cell has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies (because it is too isolated).

2. Survival: If a cell has two or three live neighbors, it remains alive (because it has the right amount of population to sustain itself).

3. Overpopulation: If a cell has more than three live neighbors, it dies (because there are too many neighbors).

4. Reproduction: If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive (because three neighboring cells "reproduce" the dead cell).


In Terms of "Patterns":

In the context of Conway's Game of Life, different initial configurations of cells can evolve into various patterns, which may include the following:

+ Still Life: Patterns that do not change over time (e.g., block, beehive).
+ Oscillators: Patterns that repeat themselves after a certain number of generations (e.g., blinker, toad).
+ Gliders: Patterns that move across the grid (e.g., glider).
+ Spaceships: Larger patterns that move in a specific direction (e.g., lightweight spaceship).
